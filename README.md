# Frontend-Mentor-order-summary
### This is a challenge that I got from frontendmentor.io 

I've been trying to learn web dev for quite some time now but I was never _consistent_.
I'm still in my learning process but I've improved a lot since I found [**"El Zero web school"** YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo)

### Creation Process

I found that beginning the design was the hardest part for me, I didn't know where to start from and to me that was a big challenge (**Getting the first _push_**).
I started step by step, setting the background image first (Which I know isn't set 100% right).
Next I created a frame for the design which I called **.card** and started setting the elements inside it 1 by 1.

### Future plans

I know that I still got a long way ahead of me specially that I have a full time job which doesn't leave me much room to study.
Hopefully I'll be able to make it but first I need to improve in **_HTML_ and _CSS_** before I move on to JS.

### Summary

I know it's not perfect but this is the first time I create something without following along a video or reading the solution at some point of the challenge.
